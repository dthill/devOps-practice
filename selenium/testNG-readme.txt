# Automate the Web Application
The presented task was rather difficult as any reliable e-commerce site today will have an automation detection tool (such as CAPTCHA) implemented making it impossible to do things like register, login or add things to a shopping-cart. This is why a very small e-commerce site had to be selected. The requested tests were implemented and some of them can run in parallel. The test related to registering and loging in are however dependant and require the registration to be completed successfully first before the login test can proceed.
All the code, including the websites url and the used credentials (including password) were published to Github. This is an extreme security failure as any user can now login to this account. This is however the only way to pass this assignment as no environmental variables can be passed along.
